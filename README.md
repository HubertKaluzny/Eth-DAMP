### Decentralised Asset Management Platform for Ethereum

A smart contract written in Solidity that interfaces with users, decentralised exchanges and asset
managers.

Written during ICHack19, my first time writing smart contracts. Comes with 2 simple web apps that
listen to emitted events. `simple-manager.sol` is an example of an implementation of a manager
smart contract. Currently only supports spot market trades on decentralised exchanges, the DAMP
charges the fee rate during deposit and currently doesn't support taking a manager's fee.
